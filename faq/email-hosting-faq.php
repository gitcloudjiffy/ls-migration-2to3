                    <p>Unless the user shares the login credentials, it is impossible to log in to othersâ€™ mailboxes. However, a few human mistakes allow others to predict passwords and attempt to login. This happens in any system and is not limited to Google Mail or so. Hence, the password must be stronger and not a weak password, users must not keep their passwords weak such as mail1234, password123, etc which are hack-able easily.</p>

                    <p>2 Step Verification, an optional but robust secured feature. For more security, you can enable and utilize the 2-step verification facility on your mailbox which means, any time you access your mailbox from a new network, Google system sends an OTP on your registered mobile, only by providing OTP you can access your mailbox. This avoids any possible unauthorized access by others into your inbox. This way, your mailbox is always safe and your data secured.</p>

                    <p>A subdomain is basically a child domain under the main domain name. For example, videos.wpbeginner.com is a subdomain of wpbeginner.com.

                    <p>Once you register a domain, you have the permission to create subdomains for it by yourself.</p>
                    <p>Subdomains are commonly used by websites to create child-sites under the same domain name. For example, a business website can create a subdomain for their blog or their online store as store.example.com or blog.example.com</p>
