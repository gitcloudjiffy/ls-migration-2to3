                                A domain name is the address of your website that people type in the browser URL bar to visit your website. In simple terms, if your website was a house, then your domain name will be its address.

                                    <li>When you enter a domain name in your web browser’s URL bar, it first sends a request to a global network of servers that form the Domain Name System (DNS).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>These servers then lookup for the name servers associated with the domain and forward the request to those name servers. DNS has only one purpose: they serve as a phone book for connecting IP addresses with corresponding domain names. These servers are called name.

                                <p>- To create your website, you need both domain name and web hosting.</p>
                                <p>- To host your website, you need both domain name and web hosting service from a hosting provider.</p>

                                <p>- We recommend getting both your domain name and hosting from the same company. This allows you to easily manage them under the same account.</p>

                                <p>- A subdomain is basically a child domain under the main domain name. For example, service.leapswitch.com is a subdomain of leapswitch.com.</p>
                                <p>- Once you register a domain, you have the permission to create subdomains for it by yourself.</p>
                                <p>- Subdomains are commonly used by websites to create child-sites under the same domain name. For example, a business website can create a subdomain for their blog or their online store as store.example.com or blog.example.com</p>
