                        A shared web hosting service refers to a web hosting service where many websites reside on one web server connected to the Internet. Each site "sits" on its own partition, or section/place on the server, to keep it separate from other sites.<br />
                        As the name suggests, you will be sharing the bandwidth, Internet connection and memory of the host machine with other customers.
