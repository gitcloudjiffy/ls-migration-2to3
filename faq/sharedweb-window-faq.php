                        A shared web hosting service refers to a web hosting service where many websites reside on one web server connected to the Internet. Each site "sits" on its own partition, or section/place on the server, to keep it separate from other sites.<br />
                        As the name suggests, you will be sharing the bandwidth, Internet connection and memory of the host machine with other customers.

                        Soft memory means RAM of the server which is divided by the number of clients on the server. The number of accounts/websites vary so we limit each client to 1GB of memory so that no single client can overload the entire server. We use SSD drives for our servers and in Business 1 plan you will get 1.5GB SSD space along with 10GB data transfer.
